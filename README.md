# Fire
This is something I have been meaning to do for a long time. <br/>
I was always totally fascinated by the demo scene of old, and the "fire" effect was one of my favorites <br/>
So I finally had a chance to do my take on it.

This is _technically_ a next.js app, because I wanted to learn more about handling rendering _outside_ of the react structure while
still being able to use the standard components, props, etc... for the controls, as it wasn't something I did a lot of in the past.
